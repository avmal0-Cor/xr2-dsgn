======================================================================
New features, Chages and Notes of the Reference Tool SDK package 
are as follows.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1 New Libraries and New Tools
----------------------------------------------------------------------
libcxml
=======
The library and compiler for the general purpose binary data format CXML conversion tool, 
which used to be provided in a separate package, are released in the SDK package. 
PLAYSTATION(R)Network Commerce
The files related to the PLAYSTATION(R)Network commerce, which used to be provided in a 
separate package, is released in the SDK package. 

Photo Utility
=============
The photo utility is a system utility that handles photo files.
Currently, it supports registration of application photo files to the system software. 

Music Utility
=============
The music utility is a system utility which provides the application with the ability to play 
music content stored in the internal hard disk drive. 
For details, please refer to the documents "Music Utility Overview" and "Music Utility 
Reference". 

Save Data Copy Utility
======================
The save data copy utility is a system utility that copies save data between the internal HDD 
and an external recording media such as the Memory Stick(TM). 
The save data copy utility supports the import of save data onto the internal HDD, as well as 
the export of save data to an external recording medium. 
For details, please refer to the documents "Save Data Copy Utility Overview" and "Save Data 
Copy Utility Reference". 

Subdisplay Utility
==================
The subdisplay utility is used to implement "remote play", which enables a PLAYSTATION(R)3 
to be operated from a PSP(TM) (PlayStation(R)Portable). 
What is different from the remote play utility is that the subdisplay utility enables 
applications to use remote play more proactively. For example, it can be used to display a 
screen on the PSP(TM) (PlayStation(R)Portable) that is different from what is displayed on the 
PLAYSTATION(R)3, and it can also be used to start and stop remote play during an application.  
For details, please refer to "Subdisplay Utility Overview" and "Subdisplay Utility Reference".

13 libusbd
----------------------------------------------------------------------
<Specification Changes>
- The specifications of the threads to be used with libusbd have been changed.  
Conventionally, libusbd used to generate the following three threads. However, the 
thread (1) has been deleted, and the threads (2) and (3) have been changed so as to be 
directly activated from the interrupt thread of Cell OS Lv-2 kernel. 
      (1) Thread for processing host controller interruptions
      (2) Thread for processing the insertion/extraction of devices
      (3) Thread for processing the callback after transfer completion
The priority of (1) used to be set with the argument event_prio of 
cellUsbdSetThreadPriority2(). However, according to the above change, the specification of 
priority with event_prio has become invalid.  
However, please set the priority of the threads so that they are high in the order of (1) > (2) 
> (3), as before. 
- It has been changed so that the system automatically deletes the registered extended 
LDD at the time of game process termination.  
According to this change, system LDD can control the device even if the game 
application forgets to delete the registered extended LDD. 

<Sample Change (samples/usbd/)>
- It has been changed so that the priority of a thread is set with 
cellUsbdSetThreadPriority2().

but the occupied memory size is small. 
      The debug version PRX performs error message output from the RSX(TM), but the 
occupied memory size is big. 
When loading the PRX of libgcm, the debug version PRX will be loaded by default. 
When loading the release version PRX, please set the GCM Debug feature invalid
